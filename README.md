# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

The primary goal of this project is to transform and analyze a dataset using SQL to uncover meaningful insights. Through data cleaning, transformation, and querying, this project aims to identify key trends, answer business questions, and support data-driven decision-making.

Specific objectives:

  *  Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
  *  Explore and summarize key metrics.
  *  Identify patterns and trends.
  *  Create actionable insights based on the analysis.

## Process
  *Loaded the dataset into SQL and explored the schema to understand data types, primary keys, and relationships between tables.

  * Identified and handled missing or inconsistent values in key columns to ensure accurate results during analysis.

  * Checked for duplicates and removed any to maintain data integrity.

  * Applied transformations to standardize data formats.
  
  * Created new table to reduce redundancy, combining sales_by_sku, and sales_report.
  
  *Used JOINs to combine tables and organize data into a more readable subset for analysis.
  
## Results
 * Analyzed total revenue by product category and region to identify high-performing areas. Discovered that certain product categories (nest and apparel) generated the most revenue.
 
 * Used ranking to identify top-selling products across cities and countries. This revealed a pattern of demand, with specific products trending in certain areas.

## Challenges 
 * I encountered challenges with creating CTEs, which led me to use subqueries instead. I found myself going down rabbit holes, performing unnecessary data cleaning despite instructions to avoid it. Weekends were particularly challenging for completing assignments, and I often felt that more time was needed to finish the project. Frequent syntax errors required extensive debugging, adding to the time and effort required.

## Future Goals
 * I realize that spending too much time on unnecessary data cleaning left me without enough time to complete some important data conversions. 
 * I need to improve my prioritization skills; when time is limited, I should focus on the most essential tasks to ensure I achieve key goals within the time-frame. 
 * I also see the value of continuing to analyze data for meaningful transformations. Additionally, this experience highlighted the importance of version control. When I deleted certain columns—mostly those with high percentages of null values—I missed the opportunity to use them in answering other potential questions. 
 * Although I wasn’t using them in this assignment, having access to that data could have improved accuracy for other analyses.
 * The QA process was challenging for me because I couldn’t complete all the steps. While I included them, knowing they were necessary, I didn’t have enough time to finish everything.

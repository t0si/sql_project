SQL Queries:

SELECT page_path_level_1,
       COUNT(*) AS path_count
FROM all_sessions
GROUP BY page_path_level_1
ORDER BY path_count DESC;

"/google+redesign/"	    42918
"/store.html"	        1152
"/asearch.html"	        1146
"/payment.html"	        39
"/yourinfo.html"	    39
"/ordercompleted.html"	27
"/asearch.html/"	    18
"/revieworder.html"	    15
	12
"/store.html/"	6
"/basket.html"	3
"/storeitem.html"	3



Question 2: How many of those path to the website actually became transactions and what was the total revenue?

SQL Queries:

SELECT page_path_level_1,
       COUNT(*)                        AS path_count,
       SUM(total_transactions_revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM all_sessions
WHERE total_transactions_revenue IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY page_path_level_1
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;



Answer:

"/google+redesign/"	    159	    23457600000
